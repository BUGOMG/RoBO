List Joel
=========

* start documentation
* mini example 
* adding predict_info_gain to example call
* Required flag to exampl calls
* allow to compute EI for arbitrary many input dimensions
* Incumbent should not be determined by the model, furthermore should EI get the incumbent as a additional parameter

List Jose
=========

* move predict_info_gain to maximize.py (-> after finished call Joel)
* take a look at https://github.com/aaronkl/spearmint to compute pmin. Its  compute_pmin_bins in  spearmint/spearmint/spearmint/chooser/EntropySearchChooser/support.py
* start documenting

Future
======

* Visualization for SampleEntropy
* UnitTests for acquisition functions maximizers ...
