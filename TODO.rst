List Joel
=========

* add sampling from the porsterior of GPy to the Wrapper model
* start documentation
* mini example 
* adding predict_info_gain to example call


List Jose
=========

* move predict_info_gain to maximize.py (-> after finished call Joel)
* move slice_ShrinkRank_nolog, sample_from_measure to robo.sampling
* take a look at https://github.com/aaronkl/spearmint to compute pmin. Its  compute_pmin_bins in  spearmint/spearmint/spearmint/chooser/EntropySearchChooser/support.py
* start documenting

Future
======

* Visualization for SampleEntropy
* UnitTests for acquisition functions maximizers ...
