Important:

Make sure you have pymatbridge installed and that walker_simulation.m and walker_simulation2.m are in the simulation folder of the three-link-walker simulator.

walker_simulation.m and walker_simulation2.m make use of the simulator's functions and act as a bridge between RoBo and simulator.

The needed simulator can be found in http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~grizzle/biped_book_web/ Â©Professor Jessy Grizzle, University of Michigan, Professor Eric Westervelt, The Ohio State University, and Mr. Ben Morris, University of Michigan.

Simply add the needed paths (matlab file and simulation) into the python files.
